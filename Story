Once upon a time, there was a clever monkey. He lived on a beautiful island, in an apple tree. 
One day, a crocodile swam to the island. ‘I’m hungry,’ he said.

So the monkey threw a red apple to the crocodile. The crocodile munched and munched. 
The next day, the crocodile came back. ‘Please, may I have two apples?’ he asked.
He ate one and gave one to his wife.
